# Lynx Metrics Analysis Guide

## Core Knowledge Base

## Before analyzing metrics, you must understand the Lynx rendering pipeline. Loading [render-pipeline.md](./render-pipeline.md) for more details.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Reading Render Pipeline

1. Read [render-pipeline](./render-pipeline.md) to understand the Lynx rendering pipeline.

### Step 2: Retrieve Metrics

1. Call `query_metrics` to retrieve First Frame and/or Update stage metrics.
2. If the `query_metrics` result contains **"Invalid Timing Flags"**: Read `[timing-flag](./timing-flag.md)` and follow the troubleshooting steps in the guide to diagnose why the flags are invalid
3. Identify **suspicious stages** based on absolute duration and ratio within the parent.

### Step 3: Deep Dive Suspicious Stages

1. For each suspicious stage or gap, according to [render-pipeline](./render-pipeline.md) to query trace data.
2. Analyze the trace data to identify the root cause of the slow stage or gap.

### Step 4: Generate Output

1. Generate the final output report based on the analysis results.

## Output Requirements

**1. Executive Summary**
A 2-3 sentence conclusion identifying the primary bottleneck (Stage, Gap, or Trigger Latency).
_Example: "Update rendering took 1080ms. The main bottleneck is trigger latency (800ms) caused by a slow NativeModule(id) request before `diffVdom(id)` started."_

**2. Metric Breakdown Table**
| Stage/Gap | Duration (ms) | Ratio | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `loadBundle(id)` | 600 | 100% | |
| **`layout(id)`** | **300** | **50%** | **Complex Text Layout** |
| [GAP] | 50 | 8% | GC Blocking |

**3. Render Pipeline Overview**
A short, narrative description (3–6 sentences) of how this page was rendered/updated:

- First-frame flow: which stages ran, how long they took, and any important inter-stage gaps.
- Update flow (if relevant): what triggered the update, timing of subsequent events, and trigger latency analysis.

**4. Prioritized Suggestions**
Provide 2-5 actionable recommendations sorted by priority.

- _If CodeCache missing_: High Priority recommendation to enable it.
- _If Trigger Latency_: Optimize the identified precursor (NativeModule, async task, etc.).

## Requirements

- Optimization Recommendations must be based on the Lynx rendering pipeline defined in [./render-pipeline](./render-pipeline.md).
- Analysis must follow the steps outlined in the Analysis Steps section.
